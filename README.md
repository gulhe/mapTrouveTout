=============

Like GeoGuessr, but less awesome, but more awesome !


This project is currently a draft (yet functionnal) version
-- Current known flaws are :

-- -- It is ugly ... I am not an artist (not in a way that society understands anyway) so this looks bad. If you are not happy with this, i'll gladly accept pull-requests regarding my css and my pictures.

-- -- I have not yet implemented bug report system, I'd like too but I'll have you know that it, currently, is 6:00 pm on a sunny friday ... Burgers are getting cold and beers are getting warm ... I'm sure you understand me.

-- -- I have not yet implemented anti "static panoramas" system.

-- -- It cruelly lacks documentation ... I'll do it soon ...

-- -- -- I mean it !

-- -- -- -- No, REALLY ! I do !

-- -- It is poorly coded despite my best efforts in the short time I've had to do it. I'd be glad to have feedbacks, mail me, message me, telepath me ... Please !
